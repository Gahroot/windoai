export const pricingFaqs: PricingFAQ[] = [
  {
    question: "What does the setup fee cover?",
    answer:
      "The setup fee covers your complete onboarding: custom AI agent training on your business, landing page or website build, ad campaign creation, CRM configuration, calendar integration, and phone number provisioning. Everything is done-for-you — you're live within 7-10 business days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my plan later?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can upgrade at any time. We'll prorate your setup fee difference and switch you over seamlessly. Most clients who start on Minimum upgrade to Pro within 60 days once they see the ROI.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the included ad budget cover?",
    answer:
      "Your ad budget is spent directly on Google and Meta ads targeting your service area. We manage everything — ad creation, targeting, optimization, and reporting. The budget listed is the minimum included; you can always add more to scale faster.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there contracts or commitments?",
    answer:
      "No long-term contracts. All plans are month-to-month after the initial setup. We earn your business every month. That said, AI marketing compounds over time — the longer you run, the better your results get.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of results can I expect?",
    answer:
      "Results vary by market and budget, but our clients typically see their first booked appointments within the first week of going live. The AI agent responds to every lead in under 60 seconds, which alone can double your booking rate compared to manual follow-up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this work for window and door companies specifically?",
    answer:
      "Yes — windoAI is built specifically for window and door manufacturers and installers. Our AI agents understand project types (replacement windows, entry doors, patio doors, storm windows), qualification criteria, and the language homeowners use when requesting quotes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does onboarding take?",
    answer:
      "Most clients are fully live within 7-10 business days. This includes AI agent training, website/landing page setup, ad campaign launch, and CRM configuration. We handle everything — you just need to show up for a 30-minute kickoff call.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are batch video ads?",
    answer:
      "Batch video ads are professionally produced short-form video ads we create for your business. Each batch includes multiple ad variations optimized for different platforms and audiences. More ads means more creative variety, which improves ad performance over time.",
  },
